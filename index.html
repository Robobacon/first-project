                <p>Welcome to my website! My name is Donell and I studied Physics and Mathematics at Loughborough University. During my course I had the opportunity to learn various programming languages such as MATLAB, C++ and R. This is where my interest in technology developed, which led me to the technical analyst course I'm currently taking with _nology! Outside of the world of tech I am also a scout and explorer scout leader, which is a lot of fun and something I hope to be able to continue with.</p>

                    </ul>
                    <p class="hide">We began this module with an intro to web basics. We covered the client/server model, the cloud, programming languages and frameworks, and what makes good software. We then looked at version control using Git, and used GitHub to push and pull some simple HTML code. We learned the basics of HTML and CSS, which I was able to use to build this website by the end of the week.</p>

                    </ul>
                    <p class="hide">We started this module by learning the Agile values and principles and what it means to work in an Agile way. We also considered the benefits and limitations of Agile, and when it might be best to use alternative techniques such as Waterfall. We then spent a lot of time exploring the Scrum framework and learning about the different roles and events. Given a set of requirements, I was able to create my own Product Backlog using Trello, which can be found in the Projects section of this website. Each backlog item contained a User Story and Acceptance Criteria, as well as a Definition of Done. By the end of the week I was able to pass the Professional Scrum Master 1 (PSM 1) exam and receive certification.</p>

                    </ul>
                    <p class="hide">In this module we looked at what makes a good requirement and how to write them. We learned more about the Definition of Done and how to make sure a feature meets it. We looked at Sprint Planning and how to decide which items to include in the Sprint Backlog and how to estimate how much work is needed to complete them. We also considered how to prioritise the Product and Sprint Backlogs, and how to prioritise defects based on their severity.</p>

                    <p class="hide">In this module we looked at the V Model and how the testing lifecycle works. We looked at the different types of testing, including Unit Testing, API Testing and User Acceptance Testing and the differences between them. We considered black box and white box testing, and did some exploratory testing of a website. We also learned the benefits of Test Driven Development (TDD) and Behaviour Driven Development (BDD). After learning about Test Documentation, I created a Test Plan for a website given a set of requirements, which can be found in the Projects section of this website.</p>

                    <p class="hide"> We began this module with an introduction to Databases and what they are used for. We learned the basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) operations in SQL and how to use it to query data. We then learned some advanced Excel techniques such as pivot tables and vlookup, and created some different graphs to visualise data. We used Excel in tandem with Tableau to visualise the data and ultimately created a Data Story to test a hypothesis, which can be found in the Projects section of this website.</p>

                    </ul>
                    <p class="hide">In this module, we learned some Professional Skills and considered the different responsibilities of a Business Analyst (BA). We talked about resilience and wellbeing and how to handle different scenarios we might face in a professional environment. We learned how to conduct interviews as a BA to elicit requirements and information. We learned about Process Flow Diagrams, Porter's Five Forces and SWOT and PESTLE analysis. We were then able to create a risk register and feasibility report for a business decision.</p>
